  <h2 class='c011'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>It</span> is usually considered necessary to introduce works of any
description, however trifling, with a few prefatory remarks. Happily
the days of dedication are nearly at their close, and an author has
now only to direct the attention of the reader to any particular
leading features.</p>

<p class='c003'>I trust that my endeavours in this <span class='sc'>Knitting Book</span>, in the
elementary instructions contained, with the full explanation of terms
and carefully executed illustrations, are conveyed with a
distinctiveness, easily to be comprehended by the learner. The designs
are original, and have repeatedly been worked with great care, to
prove their correctness; the illustrations have equally shared my
supervision; and I humbly hope and trust that it may be as successful,
and give as much satisfaction to my friends and the public, as my
<span class='sc'>Crochet Book</span>, for which I am amply rewarded by its
unprecedented success, and grateful for the many flattering
testimonials received. I must here also make some observations upon
the many cheap publications that have recently appeared (two of which
have copied <i>verbatim</i> my illustrated instructions, even to a
fault in the drawing), and to direct the attention of those of my
readers competent to understand the many plagiarisms and general
unfitness as works of instruction, of the majority, if not the whole
of those publications. I should hope, and it is needless to say, that
these remarks proceed not from the impulse of a spirit of rivalry, but
from a sincere conviction that the details and instructions therein
conveyed are calculated seriously to mislead, if not entirely prevent
and disgust the student from acquiring a proper knowledge of these
elegant and useful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span>employments, by their incorrectness; that, in short, they are nothing
more than very imperfect arrangements, copied from the really useful
Works that have been hitherto published, and tend quite as much to
injure those Who publish from experience, as those who learn in order
to derive instruction or add information to their previous knowledge.</p>

between the second and third fingers
of the left hand, leave an
end of about one yard for every
100 stitches; pass it round the
left thumb, from left to right;
then take the pin in the right
hand, placing it under the crossing
of the thread; put the needle
down the loop, and bring the
thread from the outside forward

<p class='c012'>This is the Spanish method, and
is particularly adapted for working
fine wools, by its forming a
looser stitch. Tie a loop at the
end of the thread, and put it on
the pin, holding it in the left
hand; take the other pin with
the right hand, and put it in
the loop; pass the thread between
the pins, and bring it
forward then with the right hand
pin; bring the thread through
the loop on the left pin; there
will now be a loop on each pin
as C and D; then pass the loop
D on to the left pin; repeat by
putting the right hand pin through the loop D, and passing the thread between the pins
as before.</p>

as a fixed rule; for example, when a row commences thus; knit 2 together, work as
follows:—slip the 1st stitch, knit the 2d, and turn the slipped stitch over the knitted one.</p>

<p class='c012'>(Knit 2 together, and knit 1 three times), are worked thus, knit 2 together, knit 1; knit
